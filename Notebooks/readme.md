## Introduction
This folder contains the jupyter notebooks which we employed in the systematic review.

The folder is organized as follows:

- `Merge_data.xlsx`: Contains the dataset of 1643 flavonoid entries prior to standardization.
- `Molecule standardization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used to standardize the structures of curated compounds.
- `pIC50.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used to calculate the median and interquartile range of pIC50 of presented compounds
